This repository contains some (very simple) utilities
to automate a few tasks concerning foundation level
examination questions.

WARNING: This repository **[red]#MUST NEVER#** contain any (productive) examination questions.

== Prerequisites

=== Tasks

==== Compare Changed and Original Questions
The FLWG copies some questions out to "proposed-changes-XXX" files and performs
changes, reviews etc. on those "proposed-changes" only.

This function shows the old and new versions of those "proposed-changes" to
enable a manual check (afterwards usually a merge is performed, see below).

==== Merge Changed Questions back to Production
The FLWG copies some questions out to "proposed-changes-XXX" files and performs
changes, reviews etc. on those "proposed-changes" only.

After questions have been reviewed and approved, those changes have to be merged
back into the production questions. Users should have done a
"Compare Changed and Original Questions" first...


==== Calculate Statistics about Questions
Of course, we could cound manually, but...

* count number of P, K and A questions,
* count number of possible answers
* count distribution of points (1, 2 or other) in question types P, K and A
* count length of questions

=== Questions format


== Usage

(currently a wish-list...)

[] encapsulate everything in a Docker container
[] pass filename(s) as command line parameters
[]
